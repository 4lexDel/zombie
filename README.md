    * Difficulties
- Bugs
    * We can place a bloc on a zombie => the pathfinding delay makes the zombie cheat
    * The drawer can't go back properly if we resize the screen

<br>

## Technical story
- Manage the wrong format (+ the errors throw by the save & load)
- Create a Wave object to make the zombie spawn configuration easier
- Manage performance!
    * Display the content on the screen only    > done but can be improved by breaking the loop when possible
    * Avoid useless refreshing
    * Set the FPS  > use an alternative based on the time? (usefull for the time dependent actions)
- Refactor the rotate item (DRY)
- Normalize the variable name (p vs p5...)
- Clean the useless code

- Refactor the item action management (reset booleans...)

- Every elements drawn after the player are missplaced??? => why?? >> because of the nested push/pop???
